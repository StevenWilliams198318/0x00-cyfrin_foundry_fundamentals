/**
 * Here are some suggestions for best practices and security concerns for the given smart contract:
 *
 * Best Practices:
 * 1. Use SPDX-License-Identifier: to specify the license for the contract.
 * 2. Specify the version of Solidity being used to maintain compatibility and avoid potential issues with future versions.
 * 3. Use explicit visibility for variables and functions to enhance readability and prevent accidental exposure.
 * 4. Consider using events to provide notification of important state changes within the contract.
 * 5. Add appropriate comments to improve code readability and maintainability.
 * 6. Use meaningful names for variables and functions to enhance code understanding.
 *
 * Security Concerns:
 * 1. Be cautious with using "virtual" for functions unless inheritance is intended.
 * If not needed, remove the "virtual" keyword to prevent any confusion or unintended consequences.
 * 2. Ensure that input validation is performed on function parameters to prevent unexpected behavior or malicious exploits.
 * Check if boundaries and constraints are satisfied.
 * 3. Be mindful of potential gas-related concerns.
 * Operations like adding elements to an array or mapping can have high gas costs, which might exceed the block gas limit.
 * Consider the impact on contract execution and potential denial-of-service attacks.
 * 4. Avoid storing sensitive information directly on the blockchain, as it is immutable and visible to all participants.
 * Evaluate any privacy or security implications in storing personal information like names and favorite numbers.
 * 5. Consider restricting access to critical functions by implementing access control mechanisms,
 * like modifiers or role-based access control, to prevent unauthorized access and protect against potential attacks.
 * 6. Be cautious when using external contracts or libraries and ensure they have been thoroughly audited for
 * security vulnerabilities before integrating them into your codebase.
 * 7. Consider additional security measures, such as incorporating contract upgradeability patterns or using
 * multisignature wallets for important transactions, to enhance the contract's robustness and resilience against potential attacks.
 *
 * Overall, it is important to thoroughly test the contract against common attack vectors, conduct formal
 * verification when possible, and consider utilizing security tools or external security audits to further validate the
 * contract's security posture.
